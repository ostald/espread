TO DO

- resolve density function better
- record the number of collisions an electron has undergone
- make an electron transport code by
    - calculating all excitation rates
    - callback at 10km intervalls to save results etc into histogram to save fluxes
- more energies 12 16 kev


- markov chain

- cdf of radial distribution for 1/e calculation, look into kernel density estimation

- height distirbution of spwaning  height of escaping electorns
